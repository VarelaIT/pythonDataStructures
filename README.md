Learning Python data structures. this document is generated by code itself I hope you enjoy it.

## String

A string is a sequence of characters.
```python
oneString = "hello" #>>> hello
anotherString = "world!" #>>> world!
```

The contatenate operator it the `+` symbol.
```python
gretting = oneString + " " + anotherString #>>> hello world!
```

The `len` function take a string argument and returns interger representing the length of a string.
```python
len(gretting) #>>> 12
```

Looping through strings
```python
index = 0
while index < len(greetting):
    letter = fruit[index]
    index = index + 1
    print(letter) 

for letter in greetting:
    print(letter)

#both loops will print: 
#>> h
#>> e
#>> l
#>> l
#>> o
#>> 
#>> w
#>> o
#>> r
#>> l
#>> d
#>> !
```

### String methods

### `split`

The `split` method divide the `string` by the white spaces, returning a `list` with the resulting strings.
It takes an optional `string` argument in order to change the delimiter.
```python
sentence = "With three words."
words = sentence.split() # returns ["With", "three", "words."]
```

## Files

In Python you can obtain the instance of a `file` by using the `open` built-in function.

File is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) 
of the file to be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. 
(If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is closed unless closefd is set to False.).

### `open` function
Open file and return a corresponding _file object_. If the file cannot be opened, an OSError is raised.
 
**Open Syntax**
```
open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)
```

Mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text mode.

|Char|Meaning|
|----|-------|
|'r'|open for reading (default)|
|'w'|open for writing, truncating the file first|
|'x'|open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists|
|'a'|open for writing, appending to the end of file if it exists|
|'b'|binary mode|
|'t'|text mode (default)|
|'+'|open for updating (reading and writing)|

Example of the code that writes this document:
```python
try:
    file = open("README.md", "w")
    file.write(content)
    print("File writed.")
except:
    print("Error: can't read or write file.")
```

### Reading files

`File.read()` Reads a whole file returning a string.

`File.readlines()` Reads the file returning an array of a string per line.
```python
fHanddler = open(fileName, "r")
lines = fHanddler.readlines()
for line in lines:
    print(line)
```

Here's the output of a function that reads the first 10 lines of this very file:
```md

# Python Data Structures

## String

A string is a sequence of characters.
```python
oneString = "hello" #>>> hello

```


## Lists

List are collection of data.
```python
leonidas = ["This", "is", "Sparta!"]
len(stringList) # returns 3
```

The `range` function an integer representing a size 
and returns a list ordered numbers starting from 0.
```python
for i in range(len(stringList)):
    print(i, stringList[i])
```

### Operators

The contateantion operator `+` concatenates lists returning a new list.
```python
result = ""
messenger = ["\nMessenger:", "This", "is", "madness..."]
leonidas = ["\nLeonidas:", "Madness?", "This", "is", "Sparta!"]
dialog = messenger + leonidas
for word in dialog:
    result += word + " "
print(result)
'''
Messenger: This is madness...
Leonidas: Madness? This is Sparta!
'''
```

The `in` operator returns a boolean if a value belongs to a `list`.
```python
leonidas = ["This", "is", "Sparta!"]
if("Sparta!" in leonidas):
    return True
```

### List Methods

### `append`

Adds an element to de end of the list.
```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.append(27) # now: [18, 22, 30, 25, 27]
```

### `extend`

Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable.
```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.extend([27, 19, 37]) # now: [18, 22, 30, 25, 27, 19, 37]
```

### `insert`

Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert.
```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.insert(0, 27) # now: [27, 18, 22, 30, 25]
```

### `remove`

Removes the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a ValueError if there is no such item.
```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.remove(25) # now: [18, 22, 30]
```

### `pop`

Removes the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list.
```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.pop() # now: [18, 22, 30]
ages.pop(0) # now: [22, 30]
```

### `clear`

Remove all items from the list. 
```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.clear() # now: []
```

### `index`

Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose is equal to the argument passed in the first position.
Can take 2 optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument.
Raises a ValueError if there is no such item.

```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.index(30) # returns: 2
```

### `count`

Return the number of times given value appears in the list.
```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.count(18) # returns: 1
```

### `sort`

Sort the items of the list in place.
```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.sort() # now: [18, 22, 25, 30]
```


### `reverse`

Reverse the elements of the list in place.
```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.reverse() # now: [25, 30, 22, 18]
```

### `copy`

Return a shallow copy of the list.
```python
ages = [18, 22, 30, 25]
ages.copy() # returns: [18, 22, 30, 25]
```


## Dictionaries

Dictonaries are colection of data strored in key-value paris.

### Operators

The `in` operator:
```python
count = dict()
names = ["Ismael", "Ruben", "Sohany", "Sohany", "Ismael", "Ismael"]
for name in names:
    if name not in count:
        conunt[name] = 1
    else:
        count[name] += 1

for key, value in count: # supports 2 iteration variables.
    print(key, value)
# Prints the following: 
# Ismael 3
# Ruben 1 
# Sohany 2
```

### Functions

The `list` function takes a dictionary instance and returns a list of it.
```python
keyArray = list(count.keys()) # ["Ismael", "Ruben", "Sohany"]
valueArray = list(count.values()) # [3, 1, 2]
itemArray = list(count.items()) # [("Ismael", 3), ("Ruben", 1), ("Sohany", 2)]
```   

### Methods

### `get`
```python
cesarCount = count.get("Cesar", 0) # There no key Cesar in count so cesarCount = 0
ismaelCount = count.get("Ismael", 0) # ismaelCount = 3
```


## Tuples

Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate() built-in). 
Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a `set` or `dict` instance).
```python
tuple('abc') # returns ('a', 'b', 'c') 
tuple( [1, 2, 3] ) # returns (1, 2, 3)
```

Tuples assignment:
```python
person = ("fred", 21)
name, age = person
print(name) # prints: fred
print(age) # prints: 21
```

The `>` & `<` operators
```python
(0, 23) > (-1, 24) # returns True
(0, 23) < (0, 24) # returns True
("Zod", "apple") > ("angel", "Ponking") # returns false
("Bob", "joe") < ("Bob", "tim") # returns false
```
### Example of a program that return the 10 most used words in this document.

```python
import files

def wordCount(lineList: List[str])-> dict:
    result = dict()
    for line in lineList:
        for word in line.split():
            result[word] = result.get(word, 0) + 1
    return result    

def sortDictByValue(dictionary: dict[str, int])-> List[tuple[int, str]]:
    result: List[tuple[int, str]] = []
    for word, count in dictionary:
        result.append(tuple(count, word))
    return sorted(result, reverse=True)


sortedList = tuples.sortDictByValue(tuples.wordCount(files.readFile(fileName)))
```
Here the result:

|Word|Times|
|----|-----|
|the|59|
|=|45|
|#|34|
|```|32|
|```python|30|
|a|28|
|of|26|
|in|26|
|is|22|
|###|22|
